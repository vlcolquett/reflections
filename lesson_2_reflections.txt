What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Ermm all I know is that 'git init' initializes the repository but I am
	still not sure as to what that means. Also 'git status' pulls up commits
	but I am not very clear on what that does either...

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	I think staging area is a part of git and then the working directory is just 
	the files in their designated spot on the computer. You can add files in the staging 
	area and then make commits. You can check your status for both. It helps because
	you are able to make commits to some files in staging area and can put multiple 
	or just one so that commits are customized.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
